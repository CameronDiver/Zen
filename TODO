* Type conversion steps should be detected at the semantic
layer

* When including another module, we go to the AST step only,
and get the types from there. We assume that any semantic
errors will be picked up in the imported modules compile
step. Modules are compiled to object files, and linked as
usual.

* Make if statements expressions, so they can be used in
other expressions

* Store the definition location of a variable, so we can
point to the previous definition when redefining
